### AlexaVoxCraft.Model

The `AlexaVoxCraft.Model` package contains objects that represent the request and response objects to interface with Alexa custom skills. These models were forked from the models defined in [this repository](https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet), but have been converted to use System.Text.Json for serialization.
